# Eyes
This is a project I have been working on as an assignment for my MIT boot camp for JS

# Description
This program tracks the movement of your mouse with the eyes on screen. 

# Usage
Currently made for desktop only. To use, just drag index.html file to your browser tab. Make sure all files are in the same folder.

# Future
I would like to make the eyes a full character with css and also make the eyes trace touch screen touches as well.

# Support
